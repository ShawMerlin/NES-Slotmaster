The DIY Slotmaster Version 1.8 and above will have an additional 8 pin header for conencting the expansion port pins. <br>
There are a few use cases for needing to use these pins and we wanted them here for any future projects that need them. <br>
The Everdrive will use Expansion Pin #1 for a few functions, This is Pin 17 on the 72 pin and highlighted on the PCB. <br> <br>

Use a (2x4) 8 pin straight ribbon cable and make sure the tab on each connector is facing the same direction. <br> <br>
