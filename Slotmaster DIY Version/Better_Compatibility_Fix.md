Discovered by DoritoShaman, a few games were found to not work with the Slotmaster V1.7 PCB Boards. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Example from the game Silent Service which does not display correctly. <BR>

Here are the 2 connections that we need to connect a wire between (I used 28 awg wire)<BR>
Cutting the below trace is optional, it's connected to a EXP pin that is not used. <BR>

Use a marker on the PCB Board to mark the 2 pins on the 64P connector and the 1 pin on the bottom of the 72p connector (yellow circle)<BR>

From the top of the connector, count over 15 pins and mark it with a marker.  (This is pin 15)<BR>
