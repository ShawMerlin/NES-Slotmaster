First, lets start with the PCBs.  After ordering, they will come as one PCB, snap the middle section into 2 PCBs.

It's easiest to start with the 64 pin connector.  Use the silkscreen to determine which side of the PCB it goes on. (Red) <BR>
Pay attention to the notch on the silkscreen in the middle of the connector so that the header pin cutout is correct. (Orange) <BR>

Then lets start on the 72 Pin Connector.  I like to use clamps on the sides to help hold the connectors straight. <BR>

<BR>
In total, there are 228 pins that need to be soldered.  It might seem like a lot but once you get in a rythm, it goes quickly. <BR>
It's also great practice on holding the soldering iron steady.  :) <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Take the M3x8mm screws and feed them through the bottom boards holes on either side of the 72 pin connector.  <BR> 
Tighen nuts on the other side of the PCB. <BR> 
These screws and nuts will help hold the connector tight to the board so it doesn't put more stress on the pins. <BR>

<BR>
Attach the bottom PCB to the Main NES 72 Pin Connector. <BR>

<BR>
<BR>
Attach the 64 pin cable to the bottom board and curve it backwards about 1 inch does the connector. <BR>

<BR>
<BR>
Attach the Slotmaster 3d Print to the Main NES Board using the existing 4 pegs and the existing NES Screws.  The Cross section goes at the front. <BR>

<BR>
<BR>
Moving onto the Top PCB, the 72Pin Connector sides will slot right into the top of the 3d Print.  Use the M3 x 30mm bolts or self taping screws here. <BR>

<BR>
<BR>
One last step!! plug the other end of the 64 pin cable into the top board's 64 pin header.

Test fully before buttoning back up the NES. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The NES Cartridge will stick out more now than before and will lay flat.  It's easy to grab onto and pull out when changing Cartridges. <BR>
Yes, the door will still close without hitting the cartridge.  :) <BR>
