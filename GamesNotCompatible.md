A recent issue with some games has been identified by [Aaron Perkins](https://github.com/aaronperkins) <br>
This shows certain games could have a type of cartridge which does not exetend the entire width of the pad to the edge. <br>
Instead, it goes down to a small trace that does not come into contact with the 72 pin connector. <br>
This new cartridge style seems to be on later cartridges made and could have been a way to prevent clone units from accessing them. <br>
<br>
