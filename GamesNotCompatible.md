A recent issue with some games has been identified by [Aaron Perkins](https://github.com/aaronperkins) <br>
This shows certain games could have a type of cartridge which does not exetend the entire width of the pad to the edge. <br>
Instead, it goes down to a small trace that does not come into contact with the 72 pin connector. <br> <br>
This new cartridge style seems to be on later cartridges and might have had the shorter contacts to ensure the Power/GND pins contacted first. <br>
The little tail on the end is a result of the electroplating process and didn't have any impact on cartridge connections. <br> <br> 
Thank you to [RedHerring32](https://github.com/Redherring32) for the additional info <br>
<br>
If you find one of these games, please reach out ot me so that I can include it on this page. <br>
