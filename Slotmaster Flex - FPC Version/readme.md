We have a great announcement of the flex FPC version of our Slotmaster PCB.
This will allow for all pins to be connected in a modern form factor with far less soldering.

- Footprint for ATTiny13 so the Krikzz AVRCIC can be used to bypass region lock (if desired)
- Gerbers will be released laster this week
