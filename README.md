# NES Slotmaster
A fully open-sourced drop in replacement for the 72 Pin Cartridge Slot on a Front Loader NES


# Features of the NES Slotmaster
- Open sourced, build it yourself, make changes, sell them, whatever tickles your fancy.
- No modification is need to your NES Console. Just enough skill to remove the top portion and swap the connector.
- Uses an existing 72 pin Connector. (Designing a brand new connector is not in my wheelhouse)
- The NES Cartridge is held close to the door of the NES so it's easy to grab and remove from the console.
- Minimul components, this can be built for less than $20.
- PCB uses a through hole design so this will be easier to solder for beginners.  I great first project.
- Can be used with the RF Shielding on the top and the bottom if desired, there is plenty of clearance.

The 3D Model for this design was influenced by malleetech123 on Thingiverse.  Huge shoutout to him!! <BR>
A design using FPC Cables is in the works, it won't be as beginner friendly but will have less holes to solder.
