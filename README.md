# NES Slotmaster
A fully open-sourced drop in replacement for the 72 Pin Cartridge Slot on a Front Loader NES


# Features of the NES Slotmaster
- Open sourced, build it yourself, make changes, the world is your burrito. <BR>
- No modification is need to your NES Console. Just enough skill to remove the top portion and swap the connector. <BR>
- Uses an existing 72 pin Connector. (Designing a brand new connector is not in my wheelhouse) <BR>
- The NES Cartridge is held close to the door of the NES so it's easy to grab and remove from the console. <BR>
- Minimul components, this can be built for less than $20. <BR>
- PCB uses a through hole design so this will be easier to solder for beginners.  I great first project. <BR>
- Can be used with the RF Shielding on the top and the bottom if desired, there is plenty of clearance. <BR>

The 3D Model for this design was influenced by malleetech123 on Thingiverse and built using Autodesk Fusion 360. <BR>
I recommend using 100% in-fill with FDM printing for strength or print in resin. <BR>
A design using FPC Cables is in the works, it won't be as beginner friendly but will have less holes to solder. <BR>
