## Can this be used with all the NES Shielding? <br>
Yes, A major part of this project was to get it to work perfectly with the shielding.  There is plenty of clearance. <br> <br>

## Why is there now a v1.8 SlotMaster PCB?
The SlotMaster v1.8 PCB corrects 2 pins, these were not used in v1.7 and should have been considered. With v1.8, now all NTSC NES Games will work with 100% compatibility. <br> <br>

## Is the Slotmaster V1.7 PCB still valid <br>
The v1.7 Slotmaster is still valid, it's just not 100% compatible with every single NES Game on the market.  <br>
We feel it's still valid as it will work with the majority of NES NTSC Titles. Onl<br>
If better compatibility is desired, please follow the 2 wire instruction guide that we will be providing soon. <br> <br>
